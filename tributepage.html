            <h2>FIRST FEMALE TEACHER OF INDIA</h2>
          
                <p>Savitribai Phule was an extraordinary woman who played a pioneering role in the field of education and social reform in India during the 19th century. She is widely regarded as the first female teacher of India.
                Savitribai Phule, along with her husband Jyotirao Phule, worked tirelessly to promote education, especially for girls and lower-caste individuals, at a time when such efforts were met with resistance. Her dedication to the cause of women's rights and social equality was exemplary.
                This tribute page is a humble tribute to Savitribai Phule's unwavering commitment to education and social justice. Her legacy continues to inspire and guide us in our ongoing efforts towards a more equitable society.
                She is recognised as a key character in the evolution of social reform in Maharashtra and is seen as a representation of Dalit Mang alongside the ideals of B. R. Ambedkar and Annabhau Sathe. She fought against distance and was successful in eliminating orientation- and position-based separation.
